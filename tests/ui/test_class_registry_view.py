# Assuming PyQt6 is set up for testing (e.g., QApplication instance if needed by some logic)
# For now, trying to test logic that doesn't directly require a running QApplication.
# from PyQt6.QtWidgets import QApplication # Potentially needed
# app = QApplication([]) # Keep a reference

from src.core.models import Event, Entity, ClassRegistry, AttendanceRecord
# from src.ui.class_registry_view import ClassRegistryView # Avoid direct import if testing logic separately

# If ClassRegistryView has methods that are purely logical (e.g., data transformation)
# and can be tested without instantiating the full QWidget, those could be placed here.
# However, most of its logic is tied to UI elements and their state, or DB interaction.

# For example, if there was a helper function inside ClassRegistryView like:
# def _prepare_display_data(students: List[Entity], attendance: Dict[int, str]) -> List[str]:
#     # ... logic ...
# We could extract that or test it via an instance if simple enough.
